This was a project done for a class of mine. The objective was to parse covid-19 test data from a simulated sensor input.
My program had to enforce strict data validations and perform data analysis at the end of the validation.
Valid input consists of valid consecutive batches in a string. 
Valid batch: "R5+3-2", with 5 total tests, 3 positive results, and 2 negative results.
Valid string: "R5-3+2R8-6+2R2+2-0"
